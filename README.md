The most simple application created for demonstration purposes.

Reads a list of syndication (RSS 2.0 or Atom) feed from `application.conf`, extracts entries from these feeds and stores them in the datebase.

To initiate extraction, make `GET` request to the application root (`http://localhost:9000` with default `run` parameters).

Has basic unit-test coverage.
